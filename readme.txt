ORBTR Ping is a free lead tracking plugin for WordPress websites. Ping tracks all your visitors/leads and notifies you in real-time via email when a lead returns to your website.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does ORBTR Ping store data in my WordPress database?  =

No, storing lead and visitor data locally — including all their page views — can be a huge burden on your database and may ultimately impact site performance for your visitors. All lead data is stored via the ORBTR Connect API.

= How does Ping differentiate between visitors and leads? =

We define a “visitor” as anyone who comes to your website but is not identified. A “lead” is identified when a visitor fills out a Gravity Form or Jetpack form, comments on your blog, or clicks through from an email campaign.

= How do I configure tracking from an email campaign? =

Complete instructions are included in the ORBTR Ping documentation you will receive when you register your API key at http://orbtr.net/ping
